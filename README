Belldandy - a simple, web-based bell system.

Required: 
	- mpg321
	- webserver with PHP support
	- an OS that has cron

Background:
   Belldandy was written for Logos International School to replace the iPod touch that had been installed when no local company could be sourced for a 'real' bell system. While, in principal, this could be run from any computer it was created with the vision of using a Raspberry Pi.


Installation:
Put files in an appropriate directory with appropriate permissions for web access.
Make a copy of your system crontab in cron.stub and update directories as appropriate
add the gencron.sh job run with appropriate permissions at an appropriate interval
Be very mindful of security. Don't want arbitrary jobs getting pushed in with root access!
