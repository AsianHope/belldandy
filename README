Required: 
	- mpg321
	- webserver with PHP support
	- an OS that has cron

Background:
   Belldandy was written for Logos International School to replace the iPod touch that had been installed when no local company could be sourced for a 'real' bell system. While, in principal, this could be run from any computer it was created with the vision of using a Raspberry Pi.
