Belldandy - a simple, web-based bell system.

Required: 
	- mpg321
	- webserver with PHP support
	- an OS that has cron

Background:
   Belldandy was written for Logos International School to replace the iPod touch that had been installed when no local company could be sourced for a 'real' bell system. While, in principal, this could be run from any computer it was created with the vision of using a Raspberry Pi.


Installation:
Put files in an appropriate directory with appropriate permissions for web access.
Make a copy of your system crontab.
Add a cron job to run process.php at appropriate intervals to process bells.xml into the system crontab.
Be very mindful of security. Don't want arbitrary jobs getting pushed in with root access!
